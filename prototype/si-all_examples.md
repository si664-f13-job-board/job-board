### [Survey] - Connecting Developers w/People & Organizations

Hello SI,

I am currently working with a group on developing a website for UM that connects Mobile Application Developers with projects that need development expertise in the wider Michigan community. 

We would like to gauge how individuals, not restricted to just students, would use the website. Specifically we are interested in your opinions for what you would like to see when either "looking for a project" or "looking for a developer". 

TL;DR: If you have ever wanted to find developers to work on a project for you OR have been a developer looking for a project please help us by doing the following 5 minute survey.

Let me know if you have any other questions. 

Cheers,
[name] 

*Apologies if you received this twice, my first attempt went to the wrong address so I'm trying again with the correct address.

### Coder Job Opening

We are looking for an individual who is a native English speaker who would be interested in performing labeling work for a research project we are doing. We have a large set of comments collected from a visualization-oriented news blog. We need each comment in a sample of approximately 1500 comments to be labeled with 1 or more categories that describe them (using a pre-defined rubric with 6 total classification labels). You will meet with one researcher for 0.5 to 1 hour to get you set up, then you can do the labeling remotely using your own laptop. We will check your work after you have labeled the first 100 comments.  We expect the full set of comments to take about ~10 hours to label.

Dates: ASAP through December 2013
Supervisor: [name]

Please send resumes to: [name] - [email]
