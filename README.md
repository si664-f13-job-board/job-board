Job Board For Freelance SI Students
-----------------------------------

It is quite common for us to receive requests from local businesses to hire an SI student to do freelance work for design or coding. There is no good way to do this right now other than si.all and many companies don't want to put a request up too broadly - they really want someone very local. So this site would be a virtual bulletin board to put up freelance job requests.
